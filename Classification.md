According to the American Heart Association (“AHA”), arrhythmias are any change from the normal sequence of electrical impulses, causing abnormal heart rhythms and can be either life-threatening or require medical therapy to prevent future problems. The Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) (American National Standards Institute, 2012) provides a clear guideline for grouping heartbeat types under 5 super classes. (Table 1)

The performance evaluation of any machine learning model can be done on the basis of the following metrics:
i). Accuracy 
Accuracy is defined as the ratio of correctly predicted observations to the total number of observations. The accuracy is calculated by using following Eq.

ii). Specificity 
Specificity measures the proportion of correctly identified negatives, which is described by the following Eq.

iii). Sensitivity 
Sensitivity or recall measures the proportion of correctly identified positives, which is described by the following Eq.

iv). F-measure 
F-measure is the suitable evaluation metrics for finding the effectiveness of abnormality and normality of ECG signals. These measures are statistical variability and a representation of random errors. The equation for F-measure is given in Eq.

v). Precision 
Precision is also known as Positive Predictive Value which is the ratio of relevant instances to the retrieved instances.
